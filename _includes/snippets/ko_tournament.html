This include takes care of rendering all of the details of a knockout tournament. It expects
include.data to contain "rounds", "players" and "pairings". For example, see:
_data/results/internal/2024/openko/ directory.

NB. Lack of indentation here due to how the template is included and rendered in markdown. Indentation
gets treated as a code quote rather than actual markup.
