If that game is also drawn, play a pair of games, one with white, one with black, with 20 minutes plus 10 seconds increment each per game.<br>
If the score is 1-all, play a pair of games with 7 minutes plus 3 seconds increment each per game.<br>
If those are also 1-all. repeat the 7+3 pairs of games until a winner emerges.
