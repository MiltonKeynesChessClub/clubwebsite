Milton Keynes Chess Club – Treasurers report for the year ended 31 August, 2025

2024/25 saw a net increase in membership. We started the year with 55 (2024 - 63) paid up members although 16 (2024- 24) of those did not renew. 18 (2024 - 16) new members joined during the year so the final tally was 57. (43 Normal and 14 Concessions) generating fees of £785. Compared to 2023/24 this was an increase of £70 or 10%. (2024 - 33 Normal, 22 Concessions, Fees £715). Historically, last year's membership total of 57 was the second highest it has been since I have been Treasurer. (2022/23 - 63)

Please note that all subs expire at this meeting even those of you that joined during the year.

In addition to being a paid up member of MKCC anyone who wishes to play for the club in the Beds League or in the internal competitions will have to be a member of the ECF. Please note that it is each individual member's responsibility to ensure that their details are published on the ECF list of members. If your name is not there for any reason you are not eligible to play in the above games. As many subscriptions were due for renewal on 1 September, please ensure that you are up to date with the ECF as well as with the Club.

Santander have informed us that they will start charging a £5 monthly account fee from 1<sup>st</sup> October. We are currently looking into moving our account to the Metro Bank, which does offer free banking to clubs, but will maintain the Santander account for now so please continue to use the existing details when paying your subs for the new season. We will notify the membership as soon as the new account has been activated.

A motion was made for the treasurer to approach Metro bank. And was carried.

Total expenditure in the year was £339.70.

600 scoresheets were purchased for £26.95. (4.49p per sheet)

We entered 4 teams in the Beds League @ £15 per team.

Insurance costs of £162.32 is for cover of £1m public liability. The previous year figure of £198.72 included cover for digital clocks of £36.40 which we have not renewed.

We were not charged for hosting the Club's website this year. Ask DW or MP to explain.

Recommended to keep subs at £15 for members and £10 concessions – passed

No National tournaments were entered last year.

The Christmas tournament costs were for the standard prizes.

An inventory of the Club's equipment was carried out on the 28<sup>th</sup> of August and I am happy to report that all items were accounted for. As the Club has adequate kit I do not propose to purchase any new items in the coming season. Most of the mechanical clocks, and the two cases, were donated to Baird to assist his work in promoting the game in schools. Baird made a voluntary donation of £20.00 to the Club which is shown as Other Income.

The Club enjoyed a surplus of £465.30 in the year. I estimate that we have more than 4 years' worth of expenditure in reserves. The current subscriptions is £15.00 normal and £10 for concessions. Given the state of the Club's finances I propose that we leave the rates unchanged for 2025/26.

Alan Heath (Treasurer) 04/09/2025
