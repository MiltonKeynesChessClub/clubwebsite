excerpt: Welcome to the club website refresh, 2024!
---

Welcome to the club website refresh! In the 2024 AGM, a motion was put forward and passed to form a technical sub committee that would look after and guide the club's online presence. We straight away leapt into action and began with a site refresh and hosting change. This site is the result of that work.

The new site aims to be:

1. **Accessible to all**, on mobile and on desktop devices
2. **Open to collaboration**. You can find the source code and make pull requests in our [github repo](https://github.com/MiltonKeynesChessClub/clubwebsite)
3. **Free to host**. The site is built using the Jekyll static website generator and hosted for free using Github Pages. No cost and no servers to maintain :)

Feedback and content is very welcome! Message someone from the [technical subcommittee](/about/officers.html) or find them for a chat on a club night.
