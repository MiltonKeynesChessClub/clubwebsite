The **EACU Patrick Ribbands Team Championships** will be held on **<time datetime="2026-03-01">Sunday 1st March 2026</time>** at Moreton Hall Community Centre, Bury St Edmunds (IP32 7EE). This is an excellent opportunity for our members to participate in a team tournament, either as part of a Milton Keynes team or by joining with other clubs.

## Tournament Details

The championships feature three tournaments based on aggregate team ratings:

- **Open** (no rating limit)
- **U7000** (aggregate rating of four boards)
- **U6000** (aggregate rating of four boards)

To ensure an even spread of teams across the tournaments, the organisers reserve the option of moving teams that are close to the rating limits. The tournament is limited to 20 teams, so early entry is recommended.

## Schedule

- **Round 1**: 10:00am
- **Round 2**: 12:40pm
- **Round 3**: 3:20pm
- **Prizegiving**: 5:50pm

## Format

- **Time Control**: 60 minutes plus 10 second increment per move
- **Pairings**: Jamboree pairings will be used. Each team of 4 players will play opponents from all other teams over the three rounds
- **Pre-set Pairings**: Pairings are pre-set for all rounds, so please provide names and ratings of your players when entering
- **Board Order**: Teams should play in standard rating order, but a tolerance of 100 rating points will be allowed where captains feel that the ratings do not reflect current playing strength
- **Ratings**: The ECF ratings published at the beginning of January will be used for both aggregate and board order purposes

## Entry Information

- **Entry Deadline**: <time datetime="2026-02-22">Sunday 22nd February 2026</time>
- **Entry Fee**: £20 per team (pay in cash on the day) - funds venue costs and prizes
- **Contact**: John Wickham

## Team Formation

Although designated a team championship, it is hoped that teams will be based on clubs as far as possible (or by two clubs coming together). If there are individual players who would like to take part, let John know and he will try to assemble a team from them.

## Venue Information

Free tea and coffee will be provided. There is a Tesco Express, coffee house, and pub within a couple of minutes' walk, but you may wish to bring a packed lunch given the quick turnaround between rounds.

## Interested in Participating?

If you're interested in forming a team or joining a team for this tournament, please contact John Wickham using the details above. This is a great opportunity to represent Milton Keynes Chess Club or to join with other players in the region for a competitive team event.
