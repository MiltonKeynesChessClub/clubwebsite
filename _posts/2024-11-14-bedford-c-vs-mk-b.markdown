A good performance, with the bottom three boards bringing home the result. The play on the top two boards was less impressive, but we escaped with two draws.

<h2 id="board-1">Board 1 - Andrew Bowler vs Callum Shields</h2>

This game started before the first move with Callum playing the Christmas
Jumper Gambit, which seemed a little premature to an old grump like me.
Bah Humbug! The game itself started with a slow line of the Four Knights
Opening. Although this offers white no advantage, it is strategically rich,
and I have started playing it to try to improve my understanding of such
positions. Callum did not choose the best response, and I managed to grab
the bishop pair and get a position where I could slowly build up an attack.

After twenty four moves we reached the following position.


<div class="fen-position">3n1r1k/1pp1rqpp/p1bp4/5P2/1P1BP3/2P5/P2Q2BP/4R1RK w - - 0 1</div>

White is much better here, and just has to work out a suitable plan to
increase the pressure on g7. The simplest idea is 25.Re3 with the aim of
playing Rg3 followed by either Qh6 or Bf3. This idea is so strong the engine
wants to give up the exchange by playing . . . Re5. Also, if the white queen
ever reaches h6 then black can never play . . . Rg8 to protect g7 as white then
plays QXh7+, which leads to mate.

Another, possibly more sophisticated, plan is 25.c4 with the idea of increasing
pressure on g7 with Qb2, but the first plan is simpler to follow.
In the game I didn't consider either of these plans playing the weaker 25.Bf3?!,
and after Callum's clever response 25. . . Ne6! much of my advantage had
disappeared. Not content with playing one poor move, I responded with
26.RXg7? (After the game, Callum pointed out that I could have simply
played 26.Be3, which leaves white with the better game.) and the game continued
26. . . NXg7 27.f6 Re5 (I thought that this was forced, but 27. . . Rfe8!
wins material.) 28.fXg7+ QXg7+ 29.Rg1 Qf7 30.Rg3 Qf4. At this point
Callum offered a draw, but I thought that there was still some life in the
position so played on, even though black is a little better here.
We now played another 22 moves during which I set a few feeble tricks, but
Callum defended well, and we reached the following position after fifty two
moves.

<div class="fen-position">8/8/4B3/p1p1p1kp/2P1P1b1/P5P1/5K2/8 w - - 0 1</div>

The game now finished 53.BXg4?? hXg4?? 54.a4, and we agreed to a draw. A
little thought, and it is clear that 53. . . KXg4 is a winning pawn endgame for
black. So, why the blunders on move 53? Before making my 53rd move I was
wondering what, if any, opportunities I had missed earlier in the game. Then,
accepting that the position was drawn, I quickly took the bishop expecting
Callum to retake with the pawn. I had briefly considered 53. . . KXg4, but
thought after 54.Kg2 there was still some play in the position, not even
considering 54.. . . h4!. So, I let my guard down too early, and played the
worst move I have for a very long time! I do not know what Callum was
thinking, but he was short of time, and had been playing for the draw since
his offer on move 30. I suspect he took with the bishop with the pawn as the
draw is then beyond doubt.

**The moral here is to keep concentrating until
the end, and even if you have been under pressure for most of a game, keep
looking for winning opportunities as your opponent can err on each move.**

<h2 id="board2">Board 2 - Alex Potts vs Alan Heath</h2>

Alex played the Bishop's Opening, so Alan was up against his own preferred
opening. Alan accepted a couple of structural weakness to start a king side
attack, but when this didn't break through he was left with a difficult position.
Alex then found a neat idea that enabled him to go into a winning
endgame with a knight and pawns against pawns. Unfortunately for Alex
he allowed the ending to become a pawn race with both players queening
a pawn, after which Alex had a queen and knight and Alan a queen. This
ending is a textbook draw, and Alan had no difficulties holding the draw. (It
later transpired that Alan could have won Alex's queen instead of taking his
last pawn, but that would have been a very cruel fate for Alex!)

<h2 id="board3">Board 3 - James Grimditch vs George Ward</h2>

George played a Colle Opening and a fairly equal position arose. Pieces came
off so that George had a queen, rook and knight against a queen, rook and
bishop with equal numbers of pawns. The last time I looked George had
managed to get his queen into black's back rank, but it didn't look terminal
for James. However, George produced his usual magic, and not long after
had notched up the team's first win.

<h2 id="board4">Board 3 - Mahmoud Dairi vs Thomas Evans</h2>

This game started with an f4 Sicilian Defence, but after a few moves looked
more like an Advanced French Defence. Thomas probably released the central
tension a bit too early. This resulted in a fairly equal position, but one
without a clear plan for black. Mahmoud built up an attack on the king
side, which looked threatening, but Thomas defended well, neutralising the
threats to his king. Once Mahmoud's attack had fizzled out his own king was
more vulnerable. Thomas advanced his rook to c2 along the open c file, and
a few moves later it combined with his queen to deliver mate on g2. Another
impressive performance by Thomas.

<h2 id="board5">Board 5 - Daniella Dairi vs Dominic Watson</h2>

Dominic played the Scotch Opening and Daniella erred early on and lost
a pawn. Dominic nursed his advantage until he reached a winning rook
endgame. The last time I looked he was two pawns up with one of his
pawns on its way to queening. A well played game by Dominic who gave his
opponent no chances whilst carefully converting his advantage.
