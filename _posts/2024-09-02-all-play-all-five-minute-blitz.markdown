Thank you to everyone who turned out to assist in the annual stock take last Thursday.
The stock take was followed, as usual, by an All Play All Blitz tournament, where players have just
five minutes on their clock for the whole game. You can view the complete results table of the final
standings on the results page: [2024 All play all blitz results](/results/2024/all-play-all-blitz.html).

A reminder (again) that our Milton Keynes Chess Club AGM will take place this coming Thursday, 5th September.
All members are encouraged to attend as we will be deciding, among other things, how many teams we can field in the
forth coming Bedfordshire League season.

The minutes from the previous Annual General Meeting held in September 2023 are available
<a class="nonblock" href="agm-2023.html">Here</a>, and the Agenda for this year's meeting is
available <a class="nonblock" href="agm-draft-agenda-2024.html">Here</a>.
