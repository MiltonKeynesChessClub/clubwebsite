### (a) Old Mechanical Clocks

There has bee a request from Baird McClellan to remove our old unused mechanical clocks and donate them to the chess clubs of the local schools that Baird is involved with.

### (b) Milton Keynes Chess Club Website

Dominic Watson and Micheal Page would like to propose that we form a website steering group or an on-line presence steering group (to include social media). They feel that we need to defend against the 'bus' factor; there needs to be more than one person with access to the running of the website/social media accounts.

Dominic and Micheal would also like to propose a revamp of the Milton Keynes Chess Club website, including the creation of a member's area which, among other things, could include:

* (i) Member's news and information
* (ii) Online membership applications
* (iii) Tournament pairings, with email notification when new pairings are published
* (iv) The ability to garage games
* (v) The ability to report the results of games
* (vi) Library book bookings

### (c) Bedfordshire Chess League rule change on game timing proposed by Colin Solloway

If this proposal is approved by the members of Milton Keynes Chess Club, it will&nbsp; be carried forward for approval at the Bedfordshire League AGM.

Proposal to change the Bedfordshire League rules for the timing of games - By Colin Solloway.

**FROM:**
35 moves in 70 minutes followed by a 10 minute Quick Play Finish, plus a 10 second increment on every move.

**TO:**
All moves in 80 minutes plus a 10 second increment on every move.

My argument for this change is that our current system was designed for use with mechanical clocks decades ago, when there was no increment. The quick play finish was brought in to avoid external adjudication of unfinished games, which was costly to clubs.

With the advent of digital clocks featuring the facility to include an increment, the old time control followed by a quick play finish is unnecessary. Implementing this old system on digital clocks is confusing to a number of players. For example, as captain of a team in the League, I have had a number of enquiries during matches from players wondering why the 10 minutes was not added to their clocks when they reached the 35 move mark. They expect their clocks to count moves, which they do not.

ADVANTAGES OF USING THE 'GAME IN 80 MINUTES PLUS A 10 SECOND INCREMENT' SYSTEM:

All of the confusing aspects of the old system on digital clocks is removed.
Players would no longer have to know, and agree with their opponents, when they have completed 35 moves.
The average length of games played under the new system would be the same as under the old system.
The initial setting up of the digital clocks would be simpler.

### (d) Further Bedfordshire Chess League Proposed Rule Changes

#### Proposed Rule Change 1
The League Controller is proposing the following change to the Bedfordshire Chess League rules (removal of superseded rule):

Current Rule:
> 11. Matches must start at 7:30pm unless both captains agree in advance to a different starting time. Matches should last at least three hours. Clocks are to be started at 7:30pm (or pre-agreed starting time) or if not available at this time the lost minutes are to be deducted from the time of the home team when actually started. Prior to start of any match the captains shall agree the time to stop play, subject to the above conditions.

Proposed New Rule:
> 11. Matches must start at 7:30pm unless both captains agree in advance to a different starting time. Matches should last at least three hours. Clocks are to be started at 7:30pm (or pre-agreed starting time) or if not available at this time the lost minutes are to be deducted from the time of the home team when actually started.
