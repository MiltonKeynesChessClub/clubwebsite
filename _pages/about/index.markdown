The Milton Keynes Chess Club is a place for keen chess players of all abilitities to meet for friendly and competitive chess. We meet on thursday evenings from 7.15pm at the [Berrill Cafe at the Open University Campus](/about/location.html) where you will find players playing friendly games, internal competitions and team league matches.

We are part of the [Bedfordshire Chess League](https://lms.englishchess.org.uk/lms/organisation/308) and currently enter four teams into the competition across two leagues. We also hold multiple internal competitions, including competitions open only to lower rated players.

You can see all our team results and fixtures, as well as results and pairings for internal tournaments in our [results area](/results/).

We welcome and our actively seeking new players to the club. Check out our [guide for new players](/about/new-players.html) for more information about making your first visits to the club.
